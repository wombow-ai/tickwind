# Tickwind — AI Memory & Project Context

> This file is the **persistent AI memory**. Update it every iteration with new
> decisions, state, and conventions so any future session can resume cold.

## What it is
A personal, web-based command center for global stocks (US / HK / KR): all-session
real-time prices (incl. overnight), company announcements/filings, news, and
social-media chatter — unified per stock. **Engineering-first**; LLM is an optional,
feature-flagged plugin, never on the critical path. Web only.

## Owner / infra
- GitHub: `wombow-ai/tickwind`. EDGAR User-Agent / contact email: `inverael@gmail.com`.
- Domain `tickwind.com` (on Cloudflare). **Frontend → Vercel** (auto-deploys on push
  to `main`, Root Directory `web/`). **Backend → RackNerd VPS `root@104.168.46.15`**,
  reached at `api.tickwind.com` via a **Cloudflare Tunnel**. **$0/month.**
- **Deploy flow** (backend): `rsync` the changed Go source (`internal/`, `cmd/`) to
  `/root/tickwind/` using `ssh -i ~/.ssh/tickwind_deploy`, then
  `ssh … 'cd /root/tickwind && docker compose up -d --build api'`. The VPS holds the
  source via rsync (NOT git — note macOS `._*` artifacts) + a local Postgres + the
  durable Supabase as `MARKET_DATABASE_URL` (split store). `.env` on the VPS is live —
  never overwrite it (rsync excludes it). Verify via `https://api.tickwind.com/healthz`.

## Owner habits & preferences (keep this current — context gets compacted)
- **Workflow**: drives development via `/loop` (autonomous, self-paced). Each iteration =
  one verified increment → commit (directly to `main`, solo dev) → deploy → schedule next.
  Wants **parallel subagents** for research/dev ("不要你一个人干") — research/design agents
  are reliable; for code, build it myself or fall back if a code agent socket-fails.
- **Communicates in Chinese**; wants concise, scannable progress. **"你拍板" = trust my
  judgment** on design/style/architecture — surface only genuine product decisions, decide the
  rest. Don't over-ask.
- **Verify before commit** (hard gate): `go build ./... && go vet ./... && gofmt -l .` (empty)
  + relevant `go test`; frontend `npm run build`. Then deploy + live-verify.
- **Quality bar**: "**精不在多**" — precision/correctness over quantity (e.g. ship few, correct
  indicators). Engineering-first; LLM optional/off the critical path.
- **Commercial intent**: $0 now. **MONETIZATION DEFERRED (owner, 2026-06): do NOT build any
  paid/monetization work yet** — no pricing/tiers, payment infra (Stripe/LemonSqueezy), quote-
  redistribution licensing, paywalls, or subscription gating. **Everything else on the roadmap is
  greenlit** to build autonomously (Financials, Alerts, gov-data "follow-the-money" suite, AI
  filing summaries, SEO, observability/backups, polish, HK/markets). Keep features free + quotes
  delayed. Still mind commercialization risk PROACTIVELY for *future* paid plans — esp.
  **market-quote redistribution** (Alpaca + Yahoo are RED; see `docs/feature-research-2026-06.md`)
  — but that's a later gate, not now. Default to free/redistribution-safe sources; the owner
  **will explicitly override** for specific cases (e.g. HK gray Yahoo) — honor the override + flag.
- **Security**: do NOT rotate secrets / VPS password / Supabase JWT — owner-driven before launch;
  keys handed over are for staging/use. Never touch a funded brokerage account.
- **Memory discipline**: update `CLAUDE.md` + `ROADMAP.md` + `docs/` every iteration so a
  compacted/cold session resumes correctly.

## Stack
- Backend: **Go 1.26**, stdlib-first. Module `github.com/wombow-ai/tickwind`.
- Storage behind the `store.Store` interface: `memory` (dev) + `postgres`
  (TimescaleDB + pgvector) on the server.
- Frontend: **Next.js 16** (App Router, **SSR**, TypeScript, Tailwind v4) +
  **Supabase Auth** (`@supabase/ssr`), deploy target **Vercel**. "Aurora" design.
- Later: Python **Futu** sidecar (HK/US realtime), **LLM** enrichment plugin.

## Key decisions (do not re-litigate)
- v1 is **US-first**. Data only from **free, redistribution-safe / public** sources:
  SEC EDGAR (filings), Alpaca/Finnhub (US prices incl. overnight), Reddit/StockTwits
  (social). **Multi-market** (2026-06): **TW live** (TWSE/TPEx EOD, keyless);
  **HK prices live** via Yahoo delayed quotes — an **owner-authorized "gray" source**
  (HK exchange quotes are licence-gated; `internal/yahoo`, isolated + documented) for
  the 3 names the owner follows (Tencent `0700.HK`, Zhipu/"Knowledge Atlas" `2513.HK`,
  MiniMax `0100.HK`); **HK filings via HKEXnews DEFERRED** — its titleSearchServlet
  filters only by an internal `stockId` (not the code) and `prefix.do` (code→stockId)
  is empty from here (datacenter-IP-gated); revisit from the VPS or a static stockId
  map. **KR DEFERRED** (KRX prices +
  OpenDART filings code-ready + inert; owner's KRX-site access is blocked — they'll
  supply the free KRX key later).
- **Never touch a funded brokerage account from code** — market-data only; if a broker
  API is ever needed, use an unfunded/paper key + isolation (user's explicit concern).
- LLM stays optional / behind a flag.

## Conventions
- **Go**: Google Go Style Guide + Effective Go. Doc comments on every exported
  identifier; wrap errors with `%w`; keep `go vet` + `gofmt` clean; table-driven tests.
- **TS/React**: Google TypeScript Style Guide; ESLint clean.
- **Ingestion**: each source is a small client package `internal/<source>` wired into
  the ingest scheduler.
- **Reuse OSS**: prefer proven patterns from mature projects (OpenBB, edgartools,
  OpenStock, pgx examples) over inventing.
- **Commits**: conventional (`feat:`/`chore:`/`fix:`…); end body with the
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>` trailer.
- **Verify before commit**: `go build ./... && go vet ./... && gofmt -l .` (empty);
  frontend `npm run build`.

## Run
- Backend dev (no infra): `make run` → http://localhost:8080 (memory store, live EDGAR).
- Full stack (server): `docker compose up -d --build`.

## Current state (update each iteration)
- **Session status (2026-06):** dev driven by a 5-min `/loop`, **currently PAUSED by owner**.
  Recently shipped: Financials tab, full SEO structured data, CI security, **Alerts v1**, mobile
  nav, session-badge i18n, HomeHub skeletons. Owner directives: **monetization deferred**,
  **web-push deferred**. Next when resumed: **FINRA short-interest "squeeze radar"** (verify VPS
  data access first; SEC-13F fallback). See `ROADMAP.md` for the live status + backlog.
- Phase 0 ✅ · Phase 1 ✅ · Phase 2 ✅ (prices REST + SSE live stream + frontend
  live price + Finnhub news; all auto-disable without keys). Alpaca prices
  LIVE-VERIFIED end-to-end with paper keys (local `.env`, gitignored). Finnhub
  news also LIVE-VERIFIED (real AAPL headlines). Phase 3: StockTwits social ✅
  (live-verified, no key) via `internal/stocktwits` → `Post` store →
  `/v1/stocks/{ticker}/social` + frontend `SocialFeed` (Discussion section).
  Social is now multi-source via `ingest.SocialSource` (Name + Posts) — **5
  post-based sources** in `cmd/server/main.go`'s `social` slice, each a small
  `internal/<src>` client with a `New()` + `_test.go`. The scheduler calls every
  source per ticker and `SaveSocial`s each batch; the store **merges by id**, so
  sources coexist (e.g. StockTwits + Tickertick = 60 posts for AAPL, verified).
  Sources: **StockTwits** + **Tickertick** are keyless & always on (Tickertick =
  free UGC/analysis links via `api.tickertick.com/feed?q=(and z:<t> ...)`,
  live-verified). **Reddit** rewritten to OAuth (`oauth.reddit.com`, password
  grant, UA `tickwind:com.tickwind.ingest:0.1`; the old public `.json` 403'd from
  datacenter IPs; the keyless `.rss` route is *also* 429-blocked from datacenter
  IPs — verified from the VPS — so only OAuth works server-side). **Reddit is NOT
  pursued** (owner's call, 2026-06): commercially restricted + its signal is
  already covered by ApeWisdom (buzz) + Tickertick (`T:ugc` Reddit links); the
  `internal/reddit` client stays in code, disabled by default. **Bluesky**
  `app.bsky.feed.searchPosts` (AT Protocol; session cached + 401-retry) is **LIVE**
  (creds in the VPS `.env`; ~30 finance posts/ticker, merged into the feed). **Xueqiu
  (雪球)** unofficial JSON, keyless (mints its own cookie via `/hq`), but datacenter
  IPs get soft-blocked (HTTP 200 empty body → 0 posts, no error — helps from
  residential/China egress). Each disabled/blocked source degrades to 0 posts, so
  the feed is robust. **Numeric signals** (a different shape from posts): a
  per-ticker `store.Signal` "pulse" (one row per (ticker, source); buzz facet =
  mentions/rank/upvotes/24h-deltas, sentiment facet = score/label/sample) via
  `ingest.SignalSource` (BULK — one call covers many tickers, run once per cycle
  after the per-ticker passes; `SaveSignals`/`ListSignals` upsert by (ticker,
  source), routed to the Market DB). Sources: **ApeWisdom** (`internal/apewisdom`,
  keyless — Reddit/WSB mention momentum; scans ≤3 leaderboard pages, stops when
  all wanted found) + **Alpha Vantage** (`internal/alphavantage`, NEWS_SENTIMENT,
  relevance-weighted per-ticker sentiment; free tier 25/day → the client
  self-budgets with a daily cap + ≥90-min refresh + cache, and a rate-limit reply
  marks the day spent; off without `ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY`). Served at
  `GET /v1/stocks/{ticker}/signals`; frontend `PulseBar` shows a buzz chip + a
  sentiment chip on the detail page (hidden when empty). **Trending hot list**: a
  market-wide `store.HotStock` leaderboard (one snapshot, replaced wholesale each
  cycle) built from ApeWisdom's top-40 via `ingest.HotSource` (the same apewisdom
  client doubles as SignalSource + HotSource). Heat = mentions × (1 +
  clamp(24h-growth, 0, 2)) — volume × momentum, computed/ranked in
  `ingest.rankHotList`+`heatScore` (unit-tested); served at `GET /v1/hot`, shown
  at `/hot` (`HotList`, TopNav "Hot") with mentions + Δ% (no opaque score). The
  hotlist pg table is replaced in a tx (clear+insert). **WSB board** ranks by 24h
  leaderboard rank-climb (`rank_24h_ago−rank`), NOT mention delta — ApeWisdom
  mention counts are an intraday accumulation so deltas read uniformly negative
  ("all declining"); rank is normalised → a real green/red mix (`rankClimb` +
  `RankPrev`, unit-tested). **Retention pruner** ✅ (`store.Pruner` +
  `internal/ingest/prune.go`, own goroutine off the request path, `PRUNE_EVERY`=6h):
  tiered DELETEs — news 60d/hot120, social 30d/hot90 (NEVER `source=substack`, the
  大V/Serenity rail), filings 730d, insider 90d, seen_form4 60d, + per-ticker caps
  500; hot-list tickers keep the longer window; Split forwards to the Market store;
  memory+postgres impls, tested. Env: `RETAIN_*`/`PROTECT_SOCIAL_SOURCES`/`CAP_*`.
  Clipper inbox ✅
  (`POST /v1/stocks/{ticker}/clip` → title fetch → `clip` Post; frontend paste box
  + Saved-links section). Phase 3 done. Phase 4 started: persisted editable
  watchlist ✅ (`/v1/watchlist` CRUD; scheduler + poller read it live, seeded from
  WATCHLIST; frontend add/remove board). Next in Phase 4: HK/KR FilingSource (needs
  DART key + HKEXnews scraping — deferred), optional LLM plugin, auth + polish.
- **热点话题条 (Hot Topics)** ✅: `internal/topics` — a curated keyword dictionary
  over ingested news, ranked by recency×momentum (generic-bucket demotion); atomic
  `topics.Cache` → `GET /v1/topics`, with a `?topic=` filter on `/v1/news`
  (`topics.Match`). Frontend `TopicsStrip` on the home hub.
- **机会榜 (Opportunity board)** ✅ LIVE: small-cap US stocks with **insider open-
  market buying** (SEC Form 4, code P). `internal/sec` (throttled EDGAR client:
  daily Form-4 index, `FetchForm4`, `ParseForm4` keeps only code P, dei
  shares-outstanding frames; dei `val` decoded as float64) → `store.InsiderBuy`
  (`SaveInsiderBuys`/`RecentInsiderBuys`, Market DB) → `internal/opportunity` (pure
  `Recompute`: gate market cap $300M–$2.5B = dei shares × Alpaca price, MinBuyValue
  $25k, rank by distinct buyers then $value; `ValidTicker`; atomic `Cache`), driven
  by `internal/ingest/opportunity.go` (`OpportunityIngestor`, own goroutine: sweeps
  the daily Form-4 index skipping seen accessions, backfills
  `OPPORTUNITY_BACKFILL_DAYS`, 2h ticker; needs Alpaca for prices). Market caps via
  `alpaca.Snapshots` (bulk ≤100/req, resilient — skips bad batches). Served
  `GET /v1/opportunities`; frontend `OpportunityBoard` at `/opportunities` (TopNav
  "Opportunities") — evidence-first cards ("3 insiders bought $1.2M", top buyers,
  "View SEC filing"), muted (no green-hero), on-card disclaimers. **Persisted
  seen-set** ✅ (no re-sweep on redeploy): processed Form-4 accessions are stored
  in the durable Market DB (`seen_form4` table, routed via Split; `MarkForm4Seen`
  upserts, `SeenForm4Since` loads on startup over backfill+7d/≥40d, pruned 60d).
  `OpportunityIngestor.loadSeen` seeds the in-memory set on boot — verified live
  (a restart logged `loaded seen form-4 count=3362`, board recomputed immediately).
- **大V / Guru-watch rail** ✅ LIVE: newsletter-cadence opinions from curated finance
  KOLs, anchored to tickers. `internal/substack` (public-RSS client + curated
  `Feeds` incl. **Serenity** `aleabitoreddit.substack.com/feed`; extracts cashtag
  tickers minus a stoplist; teaser only, never the full/paywalled body) →
  `internal/guru` (`Rank`: keep stock-anchored posts, dedupe by URL, newest-first,
  cap; atomic `Cache`), driven by `internal/ingest/guru.go` (`GuruIngestor`, own
  goroutine, 2h, key-free). Served `GET /v1/gurus`; frontend `GuruRail` under the
  board on `/opportunities` (author badge, $-chips deep-linking to the stock,
  "Source" link, "third-party opinions — not advice"). X/Twitter live tweets are
  NOT used (API blocked, $5k/mo) — newsletters are the proxy.
- **Home hub** = info-source entry (`HomeHub`): a live Markets strip + `TopicsStrip`,
  then **Boards & signals** (Hot stocks · Opportunity · Guru-watch) over **Feeds**
  (News · Discussion) — each module previews real items and links to its full page.
- **User features (2026-06, all live)**:
  - **私人笔记 / Notes** ✅ — per-user private notes (stock- and/or date-scoped).
    `store.Note` + `/v1/notes` (POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE, requireUser, ownership in the
    query → 404 not 403) routed to the **User** store via Split; frontend `NotesPanel`
    (compose + pinned-first list + pin/delete) on a StockView "Notes" tab + a `/notes`
    page. **Calendar view** ✅ (`NotesCalendar`): month grid over the existing
    `?from=&to=`, **compact cells** + a **two-column layout on `lg`** (grid + a sticky
    day-detail panel; defaults to today so the panel is never empty), with major
    **Events overlaid** as dots (reuses `getEvents`). `/notes` widens to `max-w-4xl`
    in calendar view.
  - **评论区 / Comments** ✅ — PUBLIC per-stock + global-board comments (§230 neutral
    host). `store.Comment` + `/v1/comments` (GET public; POST/DELETE/`{id}/report`
    auth) routed to the **Market** (durable) store; **safeguards**: per-user rate-limit
    (10/10min), report+flag, **soft-delete** (author-or-admin), admin takedown via
    `ADMIN_USER_IDS` env (matched by Supabase **UUID or email**, case-insensitive,
    via `Server.isAdmin`), IP+author+ts captured for moderation; author = email
    local-part (email/uid never exposed). Frontend `CommentsPanel` on a public
    StockView "Comments" tab + a `/community` page, with a "not investment advice"
    disclaimer. `ADMIN_USER_IDS` ✅ SET on the VPS (`allalphaplus@gmail.com`, via SSH).
    Owner TODO: finish DMCA agent registration (in progress — copyright.gov login error LG22,
    owner emailed their support) + add an on-site `/dmca` notice page before launch.
  - **K线 / K-line** ✅ — `store.Candle` + `alpaca.DailyOHLC` + `BarCache.DailyCandles`
    (≈260-bar cache) → `GET /v1/stocks/{ticker}/candles`; `web/src/lib/indicators.ts`
    (sma/ema/macd/rsi/bollinger, canonical formulas: SMA-seeded EMA, **Wilder** RSI,
    population-σ Bollinger; null warmup; compute over full history then slice);
    `KLineChart` (TradingView **lightweight-charts v5**, Apache-2.0, keep
    `attributionLogo`) — candles + MA5/10/20/60 + Volume/MACD/RSI panes, client-only.
    A **BOLL** legend chip toggles a dashed Bollinger (20,2σ) upper/lower envelope on
    the price pane (off by default; middle band = SMA20 = the MA20 line).
  - **财务信息 / Fundamentals** ✅ — free **SEC XBRL** (no quote
    license needed → safe for a future paid tier). `edgar.Fundamentals(ticker)` pulls companyfacts
    → latest-FY revenue/net-income/diluted-EPS + shares + equity (tag-priority; **weighted-avg
    shares fallback** for multi-class issuers like MSTR that omit dei shares). `ingest.FundamentalsCache`
    (24h + 1h-neg). `GET /v1/stocks/{t}/fundamentals` (`FundamentalsSource` in api) computes
    **market cap** (price×shares), **P/E** (price÷EPS, null for losses → 亏损/—), **P/B** from the
    live quote (polled, else on-demand). **Frontend `FundamentalsCard`** on StockView (compact
    6-cell grid 市值/市盈率/营收/净利润 + EPS/P/B, period chip, P/E→亏损 for losses, `fmtCompactUSD`
    T/B/M, hides on 404; i18n `fund.*`). ✅ **COMPLETE & live-verified** (AAPL $4.5T/PE41, MSTR $40.8B/PE—).
  - **提醒 / Alerts** ✅ v1 — per-user price/event alerts. `store.Alert`
    {ticker,kind,threshold,active,triggered_at} + `/v1/alerts` CRUD (requireUser, Split→User) +
    StockView auth-only "Alerts" tab (kinds: price_above/price_below/pct_move/new_filing).
    `ingest.AlertEvaluator` goroutine (every 2m): ListActiveAlerts → latest quote (BarCache) /
    latest filing → MarkAlertTriggered; frontend shows an in-app "triggered" badge. Memory+postgres
    +Split, `alerts` table, unit-tested, deployed. **web-push deferred** (owner; iOS needs a PWA).
  - **SEO** ✅ — `app/sitemap.ts` = popular ∪ live-board tickers (ISR, real-data only, ~60+ URLs);
    `/stock/[ticker]` SSR emits JSON-LD (`Corporation` + `BreadcrumbList` + financials `Dataset`) +
    canonical + company-name title (server-fetched security+fundamentals, ISR 10m). ⚠️ hreflang /
    bilingual SEO **deferred** — needs URL-level i18n (`?lang=` or `/zh|/en`); single-URL client
    toggle can't do valid hreflang.
- **On-demand collection** ✅ — `getStock` 404 for a REAL symbol (validated vs the
  symbol directory) fires `IngestOne` (fixes the "$MU all-empty" bug). `IngestOne` is
  **single-flight** (sync.Map per ticker → exactly one init collection). Frontend polls
  ~90s while collecting.
- **Commercialization risk** (for paid/AI later): see `docs/feature-research-2026-06.md`
  — **Alpaca + Yahoo quote redistribution is RED** (must move to a redistribution-
  licensed vendor before charging); SEC/Bluesky/TWSE green; Finnhub/ApeWisdom/Substack
  yellow.
- Frontend live price: `web/src/lib/useQuotes.ts` (one shared EventSource for all
  cards) + `PriceTag`/`SessionBadge`; shows "—" gracefully when `/quote` 404s.
- News: `internal/finnhub` → `News` store → `GET /v1/stocks/{ticker}/news`,
  ingested on the scheduler (needs `FINNHUB_TOKEN`); frontend `NewsTimeline`.
- API `?limit=` parsing is shared via `queryLimit` in `internal/api`.
- Prices: Alpaca REST **snapshot** (`/v2/stocks/{t}/snapshot`) → one call gives the
  latest all-session trade (feed-aware ET session classifier) **plus `prevDailyBar`
  close = `Quote.PrevClose`** (the day's change reference). `Quote` in store →
  `GET /v1/stocks/{ticker}/quote`. Poller auto-disables when `ALPACA_API_KEY/SECRET`
  are unset. Postgres `quotes.prev_close` column (idempotent `ADD COLUMN IF NOT
  EXISTS`); `GetQuote` `COALESCE(prev_close,0)`. Verified e2e locally.
- Live push: `GET /v1/stream` = Server-Sent Events via `internal/stream.Hub`
  (chose SSE over WebSocket — one-way, stdlib-only). Poller publishes each quote;
  handler sends an initial `: connected` so headers flush immediately.
- Frontend lives in `web/` (Next 16, src-dir layout): `src/app` (pages),
  `src/components`, `src/lib`. Static export to `web/out`. Detail page is
  `/stock?ticker=XYZ` (query param, no dynamic route — keeps export simple).
- Backend packages: `internal/{config,store,store/memory,store/postgres,edgar,alpaca,ingest,api}`.

## LLM enrichment (optional)
- `internal/enrich`: `Enricher` interface + `Noop` (disabled) + OpenAI-compatible
  HTTP impl (stdlib). `enrich.New(Config)` returns Noop when `LLM_API_KEY` is empty.
- `GET /v1/stocks/{ticker}/summary` summarizes recent news+social; returns 503 when
  disabled. Set `LLM_API_KEY` (+ optional `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_MODEL`) to enable.
- Stays off the critical path (per the engineering-first requirement).

## Multi-tenant + auth (商用)
- `internal/auth`: stdlib verify of Supabase JWTs. **Dispatches on `alg`:
  `ES256` → verified against the project's JWKS public keys (Supabase signs user
  tokens with asymmetric ECC keys now — this is what real logins use), `HS256` →
  legacy shared secret. Each alg uses its own key type, so no alg confusion.**
  JWKS fetched from `SUPABASE_URL/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json` (cached, refetch
  on unknown kid, rate-limited). `Middleware` attaches the user when a valid
  bearer token is present (does NOT reject anon — handlers gate via `requireUser`).
  Config: `SUPABASE_URL` (ES256, required for login) + optional
  `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` (HS256). Tested incl. real ES256 via a test JWKS.
- Data split: **shared/global** (securities, filings, quotes, news, social =
  public market data) vs **per-user** (watchlist + private clips, keyed by the
  JWT `sub` UUID). Public stock-data endpoints stay open (SEO); watchlist/clip
  endpoints 401 without a token.
- Ingestion: `ingestTickers` = default `WATCHLIST` ∪ `store.AllWatchlistTickers()`
  (deduped, capped at maxIngestTickers).
- **Split storage** (owner's call): the collected/scraped corpus (securities,
  filings, quotes, news, social) is expensive to re-collect → keep it on a
  **durable** DB (`MARKET_DATABASE_URL`, e.g. Supabase). Per-user data (watchlist,
  clips) is cheap to rebuild → keep it **local** (`USER_DATABASE_URL`, the VPS
  Postgres; OK to lose). `store.Split{Market,User}` routes each method to the right
  backend and satisfies `store.Store`, so api/ingest are unaware. main.go builds
  the Split only when BOTH urls are set; else single `DATABASE_URL` (back-compat).
  Both DBs run the same idempotent schema (unused tables stay empty). Tested in
  `internal/store/split_test.go` (routing via two memory stores).
- Config: `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` (HS256, auth) + `MARKET_DATABASE_URL` +
  `USER_DATABASE_URL` (or single `DATABASE_URL`). docker-compose points
  `USER_DATABASE_URL` at the local pg and `MARKET_DATABASE_URL` at `.env`.

## Frontend — "Aurora" data-first app (`web/`)
- **Data-first, no marketing page** (explicit user direction). Layout (per owner):
  a compact **horizontal stock strip** over a two-column **News** + **Discussion**
  feed aggregated across those tickers (each item tagged with its ticker). One
  `Board` component, `variant` prop: **`/` = Markets** (`POPULAR_TICKERS`, public)
  and **`/watchlist` = the signed-in user's tickers** (separate pages so logged-in
  users switch via the TopNav Markets/Watchlist links). Backed by batched
  `GET /v1/news`, `/v1/social`, `/v1/bars` (`?tickers=…`, **deduped by id** — a
  post/article can be tagged to several tickers, capped). All list endpoints return
  `[]` not `null`, and feed setters coerce `?? []` (a null list once crashed the
  Saved-links tab via `null.length`). Synthesized from the user's design.
- **Design system** in `web/src/components/ui/` + `web/src/lib/ui.ts` (tokens):
  light-first Aurora (teal `#2DD4BF`/sky `#0EA5E9`) with a dark variant. Signature
  `SessionBadge` (pre=amber, regular=emerald+livedot, post=violet, overnight=blue,
  closed=slate — keyed to the API's `Quote.session`), `PriceTag` (flashes on tick),
  `TimelineItem` (news/disc/clip/filing), empty/error/skeleton, toasts, Inter font,
  CSS motion in `globals.css`.
- **Theme**: `.dark` class on `<html>`, read via `useSyncExternalStore` (single
  source of truth = the DOM class) + a no-flash inline script in `layout.tsx`.
  `useTheme`/`useDark` in `web/src/lib/theme.tsx`. Default light.
- **i18n** (zh/en) ✅ mirrors the theme pattern: chosen language lives on `<html lang>`
  (no-flash inline script + `useSyncExternalStore`), single source of truth in
  `web/src/lib/i18n.tsx` (`useLang`/`useT`; `tr=useT()` in components since `t`=tokens).
  TopNav has a 中/EN toggle. **All user-facing chrome is translated** — nav, home hub,
  Board (Markets/Watchlist), Hot, News/Discussion (FeedPage), Opportunities, Guru, WSB,
  Events, stock detail (StockView + PulseBar), Topics, error/empty states, auth
  (login/signup), Footer, Settings, feed timestamps. Data (prices, headlines, company
  names, source/platform labels) shows as-sourced. `{t}`/`{n}` placeholders +`.replace()`
  for interpolation. Tab/board keys stay English where they double as state. Left in
  English by design: the `/announcements` changelog (release-notes content).
- **Auth**: `web/src/lib/auth.tsx` (`AuthProvider`/`useAuth`) tracks the Supabase
  user + exposes `getToken()`; `web/src/lib/api.ts` private calls take that token
  as `Authorization: Bearer`. `web/src/proxy.ts` refreshes the session cookie
  (Next 16 renamed `middleware`→`proxy`; guarded no-op when Supabase env is unset).
  Email/password + optional **Google OAuth** (`signInWithOAuth` → `/auth/callback`
  route's `exchangeCodeForSession`); the Google button is gated behind
  `GOOGLE_OAUTH_ENABLED` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_OAUTH=1`), hidden until configured.
- **Routes**: route groups — `(main)` = chrome (TopNav+Footer): `/`, `/stock/[ticker]`,
  `/settings`, `/announcements`; `(auth)` = centered: `/login`, `/signup`; `/designs/*`
  kept as references (self-contained). `/stock/[ticker]` is SSR with SEO metadata.
- **Responsive**: mobile-first; board/detail reflow to a single column. **TopNav**
  (rebuilt 2026-06): nav destinations come from one shared `NavItem[]` source
  (primary = Opportunities/Markets/Hot/News, `secondary` = Events/Community/+Notes-authed
  in a `More▾` dropdown). **Watchlist** is a top-level pill **when signed in** (also in
  the account menu). **< md** the desktop nav is replaced by a **hamburger → full
  mobile menu** (all destinations incl. Watchlist/Notes when authed + What's new) — the
  bar previously had NO nav links on mobile. Inline ticker search shows at **`lg`**
  (icon→dropdown below lg). Login+Signup stay visible at all widths (fits at 375px).
- **A11y**: global theme-aware keyboard focus ring in `globals.css` (`:focus-visible`
  + `--tw-focus`; element-type selectors outrank Tailwind `outline-none`, so it's
  keyboard-only). aria-current on active nav, aria-pressed + dynamic label on the
  theme toggle, aria-expanded/haspopup on the account menu + mobile search,
  aria-pressed on detail tabs; Escape closes the account menu + mobile search.
- **SEO/deploy**: `lib/config.SITE_URL` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` → prod) drives
  `metadataBase` + OpenGraph in `layout.tsx`, `app/robots.ts`, and `app/sitemap.ts`
  (board + announcements + popular stock pages). `next.config.ts` sets baseline
  security headers. Frontend deploys on **Vercel** (Root Directory `web/`); see
  `DEPLOY.md` §5. CSP intentionally deferred (would need a nonce for the no-flash
  script + allowances for Supabase/API/SSE).
- **ChangeLine renders** the day's change (signed %/▲▼) on the board tile + detail
  header whenever `quote.prev_close` is present (real Alpaca data). **Sparkline
  renders** on the detail header (`GET /v1/stocks/{ticker}/bars`) and on every
  board tile (batched `GET /v1/bars?tickers=…` — parallel fan-out over the cache,
  capped at 30, one request per board). Alpaca daily closes via `ingest.BarCache`
  (cached 1h); `api.BarSource` iface, nil-safe → empty when Alpaca is off. Still no
  fake data: empty series → nothing rendered.
- Verify: `cd web && npm run lint && npm run build` (both green; 9 lint *warnings*
  are the experimental React-Compiler rules on intentional client-fetch/mount
  patterns, downgraded to warn in `eslint.config.mjs`).
- Env (`web/.env.local`, gitignored): `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

## Tests / CI
- `make test` = `go test ./cmd/... ./internal/...` (scoped to skip `web/node_modules`).
- **CI** ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (push + PR to `main`): job **go** (build · vet ·
  gofmt-must-be-empty · `go test ./cmd/... ./internal/...`, `go-version-file: go.mod`)
  + job **web** (`npm ci` · lint · build, placeholder `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`). Actions pinned
  to **@v6** (Node24-ready). Watch a run: `gh run watch <id> --exit-status`. Green-verified.
- Covered: memory store, clip title extraction, alpaca session classifier, API
  httptest flows (health, watchlist CRUD, clip→social), and the **bars endpoints**
  (`internal/api/bars_test.go`: `/v1/bars` dedupe + cap + nil-source→empty via a
  fake `BarSource`, and the single `/v1/stocks/{t}/bars`). Each social source has a
  table-driven `_test.go` (httptest, incl. Reddit `-race`); network-dependent
  clients (edgar/finnhub/stocktwits/reddit/bluesky/tickertick/xueqiu) are also
  exercised live during dev runs.

## Environment notes (gotchas for future sessions)
- **Go proxy truncates large module zips** (e.g. `golang.org/x/text`) via
  goproxy.io/goproxy.cn in this network → use `GOPROXY=direct GOSUMDB=off` to
  fetch from git when `go get`/`go mod tidy` fails with "unexpected EOF".
- macOS dev box: **no `timeout`** command (BSD); use a background run + kill.
- `go test ./...` descends into `web/node_modules` (a stray `flatted` Go pkg);
  harmless, but list real packages (`./cmd/... ./internal/...`) — CI does this, and the
  CI go job has no `node_modules` checked out anyway.

## Pointers
- `ROADMAP.md` — phased plan + status (update each iteration).
- `DEPLOY.md` — free, domain-only deploy.
